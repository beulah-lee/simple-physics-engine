# Simple Physics Engine

This project is a simple WebGL rendering engine for simulating and rendering spheres with basic physics interactions within its bounding box. The project uses WebGL 2.0 and GLSL 3.00 ES for rendering.

## Features

- **WebGL Rendering Engine**: Utilizes WebGL 2.0 and GLSL 3.00 ES for rendering 3D spheres with basic physics interactions.
- **Sphere Mesh Generation**: Generates smooth sphere meshes using recursive triangle subdivision.
- **Particle System**: Implements a particle system with collision detection and response, including Euler integration for position and velocity updates.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Uses Blinn-Phong shading model for realistic lighting effects, including ambient, diffuse, and specular components.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to spawn and remove spheres using keyboard controls.

## Tools and Technologies
- **WebGL 2.0**: For rendering 3D graphics
- **GLSL 3.00 ES**: For writing vertex and fragment shaders
- **JavaScript**: Main programming language for the project
- **glMatrix**: Library for high-performance matrix and vector operations
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page and embedding the WebGL canvas
